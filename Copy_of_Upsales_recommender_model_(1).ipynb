        "\n",
        "This notebook builds and runs a **recommender system** that suggests the next-best financial products for existing bank customers. The goal is to help RM/branch/digital channels **prioritize who to talk to, about what, and why** — using both customer attributes and behavior patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model outputs a **ranked list of product recommendations per customer**, each with:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `customer_id` – who we should target  \n",
        "2. `product_id` / `product_type` – what we should offer  \n",
        "3. `score` – how strong the recommendation is (higher = better)  \n",
        "4. `reasons` – *why* this product was recommended (interpretable tags)\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes the output directly usable for:\n",
        "- RM lead lists,\n",
        "- outbound / dialer campaigns,\n",
        "- in-app cross-sell banners,\n",
        "- A/B testing of offer strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Problem Framing\n",
        "\n",
        "Most retail / affluent banking portfolios have:\n",
        "- **High product penetration in 1–2 products** (usually CASA + 1 credit product),\n",
        "- **Lots of headroom** in unsecured loans, premium cards, and secured/HL products,\n",
        "- **Fragmented signals** across transactions, income, demographics, and peer behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook simulates a **Next Best Offer (NBO)** / **Next Best Product (NBP)** engine that scores each (customer, product) pair and returns only the top ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Data & Signals (Conceptual)\n",
        "\n",
        "The recommender can be fed from typical banking data domains:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Customer profile**: age, income/salary band, segment (mass / mass affluent / HNI), location  \n",
        "- **Relationship**: existing products, vintage, balances  \n",
        "- **Behavior**: spends spike around salary date, card usage, repayment regularity  \n",
        "- **Peer / collaborative signals**: “customers like you also took…”  \n",
        "- **Product rules**: income thresholds, segment eligibility, HNI-only lines  \n",
        "\n",
        "In the sample output, you can see these features show up as human-readable reasons such as:\n",
        "- `Meets income requirement`\n",
        "- `Spends spike near salary`\n",
        "- `Income-product fit`\n",
        "- `Similar users liked this product`\n",
        "- `Not HNI-focused`\n",
        "\n",
        "These reasons are generated from the feature checks that fired for that (customer, product) pair.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Model / Approach (High Level)\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook follows a **hybrid recommender** pattern:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Rule / eligibility filtering**  \n",
        "   - Don’t recommend products the customer is clearly ineligible for (e.g. premium card without income).  \n",
        "   - Don’t recommend products the customer already holds (unless you allow “upgrade” scenarios).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Scoring layer**  \n",
        "   - For every eligible (customer, product), we create features and run them through a scoring function.  \n",
        "   - This can be:  \n",
        "     - a simple weighted rules engine,  \n",
        "     - a similarity / collaborative score,  \n",
        "     - or a learned model (e.g. XGBoost / LightGBM) if you have labeled “accepted offer” data.  \n",
        "   - The output is a **continuous score** between 0 and 1 (in this sample, scores are ~0.11–0.17).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Explainability**  \n",
        "   - Alongside the score, the notebook collects all the **rules/conditions that fired** and stores them in `reasons`.  \n",
        "   - This makes the model **auditable and business-friendly**.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Ranking**  \n",
        "   - For each customer, sort descending by score.  \n",
        "   - Keep top *N* (e.g. top 3 per customer) for actual campaign use.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Product Codes in Output\n",
        "\n",
        "You will see product types like:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `CC` – Credit Card (core / mass)\n",
        "- `PremiumCC` – Premium / high-limit credit card\n",
        "- `EL` – Education / Personal / Employee Loan (depending on your mapping)\n",
        "- `HL` – Home Loan / Housing Loan\n",
        "- `GL` – General Loan / Gold Loan / Term Loan (placeholder for secured / non-card lending)\n",
        "\n",
        "You can relabel these to your bank’s actual product catalogue.\n",
